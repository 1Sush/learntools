- None of the lessons seem to cover modifying dataframes, which is pretty important.
    - Adding a column to a dataframe
    - Inplace operations like resetting index, dropping null values, renaming
- Would benefit from at least one example where index labels aren't just range(n)
- Why are we setting max rows to display to 5 in each workbook?
- How many records have condition X?
- Would be fun to change up the format of questions sometimes. e.g.
    - Give them a broken pandas expression and have them fix it
    - Write a function that works with arbitrary dataframes/serieses
    - 'pepper' questions
- is `Series.isin` covered? That's really useful.
- iterating over dfs/series (I know, anathema to pandas purists, but sometimes it's just the path of least resistance)
- reset_index/set_index could use a slightly more in-depth treatment
