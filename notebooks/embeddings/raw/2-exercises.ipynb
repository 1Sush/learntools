    "We train our model by minimizing a loss function. In this case, that's the squared difference between our model's predicted rating and the actual rating. L2 regularization adds another term to our model's loss function - a \"weight penalty\". Now our model must balance making accurate predictions while keeping embedding weights not too big.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this a form of regularization, meaning it's expected to reduce overfitting to the training set. How? And what does this have to do with our obscure recommendation problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a movie has only a single rating in the dataset, our model will, in the absence of regularization, try to move its embedding around to match that one rating. However, if the model has a budget for movie weights, it's not very efficient to spend it on improving the accuracy of one rating out of 20,000,000. Popular movies will be worth assigning large weights. Obscure movies should have weights close to 0.\n",
