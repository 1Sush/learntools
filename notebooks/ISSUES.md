- Clarify separation of concerns wrt macro processing (see comment at top of `macro_processing.py`)
- Split out per-macro logic for cell-level (%%) macros
- Reimplement HIDE macros as cell-level (rather than using 'expander' $ syntax)
- Would be really nice to have some way to write 'testing' exercise notebooks (including debugging cells marked with `#%%RM_IF(PROD)%%` for testing checking code) to separate kernel ids.
    - I think maybe solution is to make dev/testing into flags for render.py (slash prepare_push.py slash some script coordinating both steps) rather than putting them in that config yaml file. Testing flag would write rendered notebooks and metadata files to different subdirectories (and the metadata files would have different ids).
- can (probably) remove `/kaggle/working` hack from pip install learntools hack.
